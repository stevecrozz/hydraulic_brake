# HydraulicBrake [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/stevecrozz/hydraulic_brake.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/stevecrozz/hydraulic_brake)

## ATTENTION

*This gem is not maintained*

Airbrake has release v5 of its [airbrake
gem](https://github.com/errbit/errbit/issues/1012), and a companion gem
[airbrake-ruby](https://github.com/airbrake/airbrake-ruby) which addresses all
of my [original complaints](https://github.com/airbrake/airbrake/pull/132)
which were the reasons for my creating this gem.

The airbrake-ruby gem should be a drop-in replacement for hydraulic_brake and I
recommend users adopt it going forward.

If you're interested in documentation for a released version of
hydraulic_brake, you can check out the README.md file for a prior version:
