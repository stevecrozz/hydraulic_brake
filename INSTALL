=== Configuration

You should have something like this in config/initializers/hydraulic_brake.rb.

  HydraulicBrake.configure do |config|
    config.api_key = '1234567890abcdef'
  end

(Please note that this configuration should be in a global configuration, and
is *not* environment-specific. HydraulicBrake is smart enough to know what
errors are caused by what environments, so your staging errors don't get mixed
in with your production errors.)

You can test that HydraulicBrake is working in your production environment by
using this rake task:

  rake hydraulicbrake:test

If everything is configured properly, that task will send a notice to Airbrake
which will be visible immediately.
